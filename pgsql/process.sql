-- This file is multi-processed in parallel and requires that statements
-- are written to work well being run multiple times at once. At run-time
-- the variables :cores and :mod are available to allow you to split up
-- your statements by id based on the number of processes being run. In
-- most cases you can use them by adding a condition like this:
-- [...] WHERE (gid % :procs) = :proc [...]
